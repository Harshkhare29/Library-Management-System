# Library-Management-System
A Library Management System in Java typically involves creating classes that represent the library's books, patrons, and the transactions such as issuing and returning books. Below is a basic version of a Library Management System in Java that handles the addition of books, issuing and returning books, and displaying the available books.
Book Class: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
User Class: Represents a user with a name and user ID.
Library Class: Manages the collection of books and users, allowing for adding books/users, borrowing, and returning books.
Main Application: Demonstrates how to use the library management system by adding books and users, borrowing and returning books, and listing available books.
